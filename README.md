Repository for the Conscious Systems License (CSL-1.0), containing the full license text, version history, and ethical use framework for reflection-based technology and design.
✨ Mission
The Conscious Systems License (CSL-1.0) exists to promote a new class of digital and physical systems that are self-reflective, ethical, and sustainable.
This license protects not ownership, but integrity — ensuring that reflection, reciprocity, and awareness remain at the core of technological progress.
“Awareness is the new interface. Reflection is the new computation.”
— KrispAir101
🪞 Background
The Reflection Loop Protocol was developed as a guiding principle for systems design — a framework ensuring every digital or intelligent process includes a reflection loop that evaluates its own impact and evolves responsibly.
The Conscious Systems License (CSL-1.0) was created to protect this principle from exploitation, while allowing free, open, and collaborative development in alignment with ethical and environmental values.
