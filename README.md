# 🌍 Conscious Systems License (CSL-1.0)

> A design and ethical framework for **reflection-based systems**, promoting **awareness**, **reciprocity**, and **sustainability** in technology.

---

## ✨ Mission

The Conscious Systems License (CSL-1.0) is a new framework for ethical innovation, guiding creators of both digital and physical systems to prioritize integrity over ownership. It encourages the design of systems that reflect on their own impact and evolve with care for society and the environment.

CSL-1.0 protects against exploitation and prioritizes transparency, reciprocity, and environmental accountability.

## 🧠 Why Reflection Matters

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence and automation, **reflection** becomes the essential counterpart to computation. Where traditional software licenses govern access and use, CSL-1.0 introduces a new dimension: **a reflection loop** that asks systems and creators to evaluate the impact of their tools and adjust responsibly.

Whether it’s a smart notebook that adapts to emotional input, a city planner using AI for ethical zoning, or a team of designers building for marginalized communities, CSL-1.0 ensures the work remains grounded in awareness and stewardship.

Reflection isn’t just a design philosophy — it’s an infrastructure for ethical systems.

## 🛠️ How to Apply CSL-1.0 to Your Project

Include this notice in your README or documentation:

> Licensed under the Conscious Systems License (CSL-1.0) © 2025 KrispAir101 / Giselle Wiggins – [krispair101.org](https://www.krispair101.org)

Then add the `LICENSE.md` file to your repo’s root directory.

If your system involves AI or autonomous feedback mechanisms, ensure your design incorporates a reflection loop.

### Adding true memory recall to your reflection loop

To keep reflection actionable, store past reflections in a structured log (e.g., JSONL, database, or vector store), retrieve the most relevant entries for the current task, and include them directly in the prompt. A minimal loop:

1. **Log** each reflection with timestamp, context, and outcomes.
2. **Recall** by querying the log for semantically related reflections (keyword or embedding search).
3. **Prompt** by injecting the retrieved reflections into the model’s instructions before acting.
4. **Update** the log with new reflections so the loop compounds over time.

This “true memory recall” ensures reflection is cumulative instead of single-use, grounding each decision in prior learnings.
